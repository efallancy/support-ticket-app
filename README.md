# Support Ticket Platform

A demonstration of a mini support ticket management platform.

## Getting started

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project uses PNPM package manager to manage any dependencies
> and thus, it requires PNPM to be installed.

Ensure all relevant dependencies are installed, by running the following command:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

To start the services, run the following command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

By default, the app and API will be started in:
- `http://localhost:5173` (App)
- `http://localhost:3000` (API)
